    content: `# How to Play the Bongo Drums

## Introduction
Bongo drums are a pair of small, open-bottomed drums of different sizes. They originated in Cuba and are commonly used in Latin American music, particularly in salsa, son cubano, and Afro-Cuban jazz. The smaller drum is called the "macho" (male) and the larger one is called the "hembra" (female).

## Basic Techniques

### Hand Positions
- **Open Tone**: Strike the edge of the drum with your fingertips, allowing the hand to bounce off immediately for a clear, resonant sound.
- **Bass Tone**: Strike the center of the drum with the full palm of your hand for a deep, low sound.
- **Slap**: Strike the edge of the drum with your fingertips, but keep them on the head momentarily to create a sharp, high-pitched sound.
- **Muted Tone**: Similar to the open tone, but keep your hand on the drum head to dampen the sound.

## How to Hold and Position the Bongos

1. **Seated Position**: Sit with the bongos between your knees. The smaller drum (macho) should be on your dominant hand side.
2. **Hand Position**: Keep your hands relaxed and slightly cupped.
3. **Posture**: Sit with a straight back to prevent fatigue during long playing sessions.

## Common Rhythms for Beginners

### Martillo (The Hammer)
This is the most basic bongo pattern:
1. Play a bass tone on the larger drum with your non-dominant hand
2. Follow with two open tones on the smaller drum with your dominant hand
3. Repeat this three-note pattern continuously

### Simple Alternating Pattern
1. Play an open tone on the larger drum
2. Play an open tone on the smaller drum
3. Repeat, gradually increasing speed as you become comfortable

## Practice Tips

1. **Start Slow**: Begin practicing at a slow tempo and gradually increase speed as you gain confidence.
2. **Use a Metronome**: Practice with a metronome to develop a consistent sense of timing.
3. **Listen to Bongo Players**: Listen to experienced bongo players to understand the rhythms and techniques.
4. **Record Yourself**: Recording your practice sessions helps identify areas for improvement.
5. **Daily Practice**: Even 10-15 minutes of daily practice will yield better results than occasional longer sessions.

Remember that bongo playing is as much about feeling the rhythm as it is about technique. Enjoy the process of learning this expressive instrument!`,

  guitar: {
    content: `# How to Play the Guitar

## Introduction
The guitar is a versatile string instrument with six strings, played by strumming or plucking the strings with one hand while the other hand presses the strings against frets on the fingerboard. Guitars come in acoustic, electric, and classical varieties, each with its own unique sound and playing style.

## Basic Techniques

### Hand Positions
- **Fretting Hand**: Usually your left hand (right if you're left-handed). This hand presses down on the strings against the fretboard to create different notes.
- **Picking Hand**: Usually your right hand. This hand strums or plucks the strings to produce sound.

### Basic Chords for Beginners
Start with these essential chords:
- **E major**: Place fingers on the 2nd fret of the A string, 2nd fret of the D string, and 1st fret of the G string.
- **A major**: Place fingers on the 2nd fret of the D, G, and B strings.
- **D major**: Place fingers on the 2nd fret of the G string, 2nd fret of the E string, and 3rd fret of the B string.
- **G major**: Place fingers on the 3rd fret of the E string, 2nd fret of the A string, and 3rd fret of the E string.
- **C major**: Place fingers on the 3rd fret of the A string, 2nd fret of the D string, and 1st fret of the B string.

## How to Hold the Guitar Correctly

1. **Seated Position**: Sit with your back straight and the guitar resting on your right leg (left if you're left-handed).
2. **Guitar Body**: The curve of the guitar should rest comfortably against your body.
3. **Neck Position**: Hold the neck with your thumb positioned roughly in the middle of the back of the neck.
4. **Fretting Hand**: Keep your fingers curved and use fingertips to press down on strings.
5. **Picking Hand**: Position your hand over the sound hole (acoustic) or pickups (electric).

## Common Strumming Patterns for Beginners

### Basic Down Strum
- Simply strum downward across all strings in a steady rhythm.

### Down-Up Strum
- Strum down, then up, in a continuous motion.
- Count "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and" with down strums on numbers and up strums on "and".

### Four-Beat Pattern
- Down, down, up, down, up
- This creates a rhythm that sounds like "ONE, TWO, three-AND, FOUR-and"

## Practice Tips

1. **Start Slow**: Begin with simple chords and strumming patterns before advancing.
2. **Regular Practice**: Even 15-20 minutes daily is better than occasional longer sessions.
3. **Use a Metronome**: Practice with a metronome to develop timing and rhythm.
4. **Finger Exercises**: Do finger exercises to build strength and dexterity.
5. **Learn Songs You Love**: Stay motivated by learning songs you enjoy.
6. **Record Yourself**: Recording your playing helps identify areas for improvement.
7. **Rest When Needed**: Take breaks if your fingers hurt; calluses will develop over time.

Remember that learning guitar takes time and patience. Celebrate small victories and enjoy the journey of learning this wonderful instrument!`,

- Keep your lips relaxed but corners firm
- Direct the airstream downward into the flute

### Breathing
- Breathe from your diaphragm, not just your chest
- Take full, deep breaths
- Support your air stream with consistent abdominal pressure
- Practice breathing exercises to increase capacity
